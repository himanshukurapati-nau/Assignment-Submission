# License Justification

We chose **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)** to base this project on, since it has the strongest focus on user freedoms and the most open collaborative position. The AGPL ensures that improvements to the code must be open-sourced even if the code is being distributed over the network. This is in line with our aim of encouraging contributions such as bug fixes and feature additions while preventing commercial use without proper licensing. It maintains the integrity of the project while fostering an open and collaborative environment.
